Synchronized PDF presentations in the browser
---

Use cases:

- You're presenting some slides at a meeting. Jim and Lauren are
  calling in from a remote office. You upload your slides to pdfshow
  and send everyone a pdfshow link. Now, everyone's view of the
  content is automatically synchronized. No more calling out "Ok, are
  you looking at slide 35?"

- You're giving a presentation via video conference. Pdfshow
  synchronizes the slide presentation. You use the big TV to see the
  faces of people calling in by video conference.

- You're about to give a presentation but forgot to bring the special
  adapter that hooks your laptop up to the projector. Or you've
  forgotten the projector code. Or the ghost in the machine doesn't
  like you today. You give up and present your slides using pdfshow.
